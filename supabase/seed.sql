-- TrueNamePath: Local Development Seed Data
-- Purpose: Quick seed script for `supabase db reset`
-- Usage: This file is automatically executed when running `supabase db reset`

-- Since the demo personas are already created in migration 021, 
-- this seed file is kept minimal to avoid conflicts

-- Additional development-specific seed data can be added here if needed
SELECT 'TrueNamePath seed.sql: Demo personas already seeded via migration 021' as seed_status;
